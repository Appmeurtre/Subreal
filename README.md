## 🎯 About

Hey, I'm ylmzart. I created Subreal because I believe that powerful tools don't need to be bloated. After years of wrestling with sluggish, complex IDEs, I wanted to create a development environment for Unreal Engine that was lightweight, fast, and intuitive.

Subreal is a terminal-based GUI that provides all the essential tools for professional Unreal Engine development in a single, cohesive package. It's designed to be a pleasure to use, with a carefully crafted orange-themed interface that's both functional and easy on the eyes.

This project is my answer to the bloat and complexity of modern development tools. It's for developers who value speed, efficiency, and a clean, focused workflow.

### 🏗️ **Project Management**
- **Project Building**: Visual progress tracking with detailed error reporting
- **Editor Launch**: Direct Unreal Editor launching with validation
- **Project Information**: Comprehensive project analysis and path validation
- **Directory Management**: Quick access to project folders and files

### 🔧 **Advanced Project Renaming**
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies Blueprint-only vs C++ projects
- **Safe Renaming**: Creates backups before any modifications
- **C++ Support**: Handles source files, headers, modules, and build configurations
- **Blueprint Support**: Simple renaming with configuration updates

### 🧹 **Project Cleanup**
